To everyone in 3020

It is February 2, 2020 now. There are currently about 200 countries on the planet, each with its own government. I am a general citizen of Japan.
This time I heard that this archive will be kept for 1000 years, so I decided to post the code currently under development. Are you riding properly?

Artificial intelligence has been a dream of mankind since the early days of computers. Then, in 2012, the technology called deep learning became popular, and it was about to spread to society. There are those who are worried about what will happen in the future and those who have hope.

What I want to keep in mind here is that humanity has entrusted the future dreams to computers and children.
If you want to know the past software and computers, I think the quickest way is to search for the phrase Linux or Unix.
See you in 1000 years. 
Now you are connected to us.
